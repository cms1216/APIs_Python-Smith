In this sample JSON code, we are seeing the api output for a github account named \"jackfrued\" and his different URLs for pages such as his followers, repositiories, and user information. Specificaly, we are looking at his repositiory named \"Python-100-days\". Some specific datafields I see are the multiple URLs to use, the laguange the code is written in, and size of the repository. When we bring this code into python, I'm not really sure what it would output but I assume it would output a page that is similar to the page that is being referenced in the code. </blockquote>"
